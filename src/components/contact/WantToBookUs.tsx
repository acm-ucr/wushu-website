            We love to perform for school events as well as off-campus
            organizations! Weâ€™ve performed for APSP, ASPB, CSA, NSU, and more on
            campus, as well as for the Rancho Cucamonga Lunar New Year Festival
            off-campus. Please email us with a time, location, and any other
            logistical details about the event! We perform for free and our
            performances are usually within 10 minutes of runtime.
